# Text-Classification-System
This project implements a Text Classification System using Machine Learning techniques. The system processes raw text data, performs necessary preprocessing steps, and classifies the text into predefined categories. For this assignment, a Spam Detection use case has been implemented, where SMS messages are classified as Spam or Ham (Not Spam).
